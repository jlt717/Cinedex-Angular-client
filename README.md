## About
This single-paged responsive app uses routing and multiple interface views to provide a number of features to film lovers. CineDEX users can register, login, update their profiles, search for movies by title, genre, or director and even create a favorite movie list where they can add or remove favorites. CineDEX also provides users with information about an assortment of movies, directors, and genres.

This complete web app integrates the client-side code using Angular with the server-side code using REST and a database.
